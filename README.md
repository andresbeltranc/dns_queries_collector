# Explain what is the computational complexity of your ranking algorithm
the algorithmic complexity of the Ranking algorithm is O(n) because it can be said that the ranking algorithm is a liniar time algorithm because when runnning the algorithm the time increases linearly with the size of the input in this case the amount of recorst that will be analyzed.
